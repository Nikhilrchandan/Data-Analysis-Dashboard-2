## Process
1.	Data Collection: Extract ride history, customer feedback, and driver details.
2.	Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends and patterns using visualizations.
4.	Modeling & Forecasting: Use predictive analytics to estimate demand and optimize pricing.
5.	Insights & Reporting: Create dashboards to visualize key metrics for stakeholders.
   

## Project Insights
•	The majority of rides occur during peak office hours, indicating high demand in urban areas.
•	Customers prefer shorter rides, with an average trip distance of 5-10 km.
•	Surge pricing increases revenue but leads to a temporary decline in ride requests.
•	Driver ratings are highly influenced by ride quality and punctuality.

## Final Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into ride-sharing trends, customer preferences, and driver performance.
By leveraging these insights, Ola can enhance its service quality, optimize pricing strategies, 
and improve driver allocation to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction.
